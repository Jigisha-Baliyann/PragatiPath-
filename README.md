## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Backend (.env)**
```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/civic-issue-platform
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
JWT_EXPIRE=30d
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-google-maps-key
GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY=your-vision-api-key
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
